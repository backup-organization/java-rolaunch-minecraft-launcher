# Java-RoLaunch-Minecraft-Launcher
A new self made launcher with a built in proxy to be used in school environments or to be used cracked.

Chose either .exe or .jar. The only difference is that the .exe has a cool favicon. Howvwer, the .jar is suitable for school environments.

.jar has been updated with libraries to work alon, instead of libraries installed. Should work on new computers now.

RoLaunch v2 adds username autologin and had been reoptimized.However, libraries may not instal correctly at school.

*Don't use the .exe. It hasn't been updated.*

# Error and Exception Fix
```
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program wil exit.
```

This generally happens in RoLaunch v2 whiel setting up inintially. Select Edit Profile. Under Java Settings (Advanced), enable JVM arguments, and clear all text in the text box.
*This launcher doesn not support reallocation of RAM at the moment.*
