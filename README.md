# Java-RoLaunch-Minecraft-Launcher
A new self made launcher with a built in proxy to be used in school environments or to be used cracked.

Chose either .exe or .jar. The only difference is that the .exe has a cool favicon. Howvwer, the .jar is suitable for school environments.

.jar has been updated with libraries to work alon, instead of libraries installed. Should work on new computers now.

*Don't use the .exe. It hasn't been updated.*
